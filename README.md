# Computer Graphics

This repository showcases the projects I did in CMSC420 Computer Graphics course by Professor Gregg.

## Projects

A part of the projects I did in the course.

### Bump Mapping ([Source codes](https://github.com/hikarimn/ComputerGraphics/tree/master/BumpMapping))
* Made light sources movable with a mouse
* Mapped simple textures to a scene and objects
* Implemented [Bump Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_mapping) 


### Gateway Arch ([Source codes](https://github.com/hikarimn/ComputerGraphics/tree/master/Arch/LightingVS))
* Wrote a program that draws the [Gateway Arch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch)
* Implemented [Frenet-frame technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenetâ€“Serret_formulas) and [Catenary curve](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Catenary.html)
* Added a feature that will allow the user to move around in the scene and rotate their view direction by pressing keys


## Tools

* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org) - A cross-language, cross platform application programming interface(API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.
* [OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)](https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/tutorials/ClockworkCoders/glsl_overview.php) - A principal shading language for OpenGL.
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) - An IDE
